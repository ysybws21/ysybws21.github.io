So we spoke over the phone. You said you needed time to heal.

I have so many things I want to tell you. So many things I want to say.

So I created this. I have no idea. You may find this one day, you may not.

But this will be a testament somewhere, to anyone who stumbles across this, that I will always love a girl.

It is a silly idea. That maybe, one day, you will miss me enough to start googling stupid stuff.

And you will remember this little secret that we have. A throwback to happier times.

And maybe you will read this.

And maybe you will be ok enough for us to even talk.

I know. Such a silly little pipedream.

But this is all I have. One small space on the Internet.
